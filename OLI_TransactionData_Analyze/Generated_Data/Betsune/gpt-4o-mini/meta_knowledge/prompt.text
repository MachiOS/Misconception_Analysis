ID:29 ====================================	
    Question: In addition to chlorophyll, plants produce other pigments. Some of them act as “helpers” to chlorophyll: they absorb different wavelengths of light and pass some of the energy to chlorophyll. For example, many plants contain orange and yellow pigments in their leaves. They are normally masked by the green chlorophyll, which is much more abundant in leaf tissues. When do we see these pigments in many plant leaves?

ID:33 ====================================	
    Question: In medical science, the goal is often to figure out how a disease works or to test out a therapy. Ideally, experiments should be done on humans. Yet the most informative experiments might also involve some pretty rough stuff: deliberately disabling a gene to see if it causes a disorder, testing a potentially dangerous drug, and so on. We cannot ethically do such experiments on humans. How do biomedical researchers get the needed research done without harming human subjects?

    Question: Scientists turn to model organisms — species that are easy to keep in the lab and have been studied extensively — and use them as study subjects. Rats and mice, for example, are key to medical research. Dozens of mouse and rat strains have been specifically maintained as research subjects because they reliably develop problems like obesity, diabetes, or behavioral disorders such as addiction. How could research on mice or rats help answer our medical research questions — questions that are, after all, about humans?
