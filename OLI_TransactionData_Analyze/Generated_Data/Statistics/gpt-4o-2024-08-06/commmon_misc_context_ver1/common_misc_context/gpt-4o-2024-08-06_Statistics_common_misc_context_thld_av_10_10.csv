    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** If a 95% confidence interval for the average height of students is (150 cm, 175 cm), what does this interval suggest about the true average height?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""There is a 95% probability that the true average height is between 150 cm and 175 cm.""

- **Misconception 2:** A narrower confidence interval always means a better estimate.  
    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** Compare the confidence intervals [50, 60] and [55, 65] for estimating a population mean. Which is better and why?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""The interval [50, 60] is better because it's narrower.""

- **Misconception 3:** Increasing the sample size always results in a higher confidence level.  
    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** What effect does increasing the sample size from 100 to 200 have on both the confidence interval and confidence level?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""It increases the confidence level.""

- **Misconception 4:** The boundaries of a confidence interval are exact limits within which the population parameter must fall.  
    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** Can the true population average ever be outside the calculated confidence interval?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""No, it must be within those boundaries.""

- **Misconception 5:** Two confidence intervals with overlapping ranges mean they estimate the same population parameter.  
    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** If two 95% confidence intervals for two different studies on average height are [150, 170] and [160, 180], what can we conclude about the populations?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""The two populations have the same average height because the intervals overlap.""

### 2. Point Estimate  
**Misconceptions:**

- **Misconception 1:** A point estimate is always accurate if it is within a confidence interval.  
    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** The point estimate of a population mean is 55 with a corresponding confidence interval of [50, 60]. What does this tell us about the accuracy of the point estimate?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""The point estimate must be accurate because it falls within the interval.""

- **Misconception 2:** The point estimate is the midpoint of a confidence interval.  
    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** If the confidence interval for a population mean is [70, 90], what is the point estimate?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""It's 80 because that's the midpoint of 70 and 90.""

      **Question:** Why might someone object to increasing the sample size in a study?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""Because it might make the sample less representative.""

- **Misconception 3:** Sample size is irrelevant once a minimum number has been reached.  
    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** After reaching the minimum sample size for statistical power, does increasing it further have any impact?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""No, it doesn't make any difference once the minimum is reached.""

- **Misconception 4:** Sample size must be proportional to the population size.  
    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** If a population is 1 million, how should you determine a suitable sample size?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""It has to be proportional, like 10% of the population.""

    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** Do equal sample sizes in different studies ensure equal reliability in their estimates?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""Yes, they are equally reliable because the sample sizes are the same.""

### 5. Level of Confidence  
**Misconceptions:**

- **Misconception 1:** A higher confidence level always means a better estimate.  
    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** Compare a 90% confidence interval of [100, 110] and a 99% confidence interval of [95, 115]. Which is better, and why?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""The 99% interval is better because it has a higher confidence level.""

- **Misconception 2:** The level of confidence is a characteristic of the data set, not a choice by the researcher.  
    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** Why might a researcher choose a 95% confidence level over a 90% one?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""You can't choose; it is a given property of the data.""

- **Misconception 3:** Increasing the confidence level decreases the need for a larger sample size.  
    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** If you increase your desired confidence level from 90% to 99%, what impact does this have on sample size requirements?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""You can actually use a smaller sample size because the confidence level is higher.""

- **Misconception 4:** The level of confidence is a measure of accuracy of the point estimate.  
    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** If your point estimate is 45 with a 95% confidence level, how does this relate to the accuracy of the estimate?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""The 95% confidence level means the estimate is 95% accurate.""

- **Misconception 5:** Confidence levels can be more than 100% if the data is perfect.  
    - *Example Context:*  
      **Question:** In a study with well-controlled conditions and reliable data, can confidence levels exceed 100%?  
      **Students' Responses:** ""Yes, the more perfect the data, the higher the confidence level, even beyond 100%."""

1. **Independent Events**

    Misconceptions:
    
    a. Misconception: If events are independent, knowing the outcome of one event can still affect the probability of the other event occurring.

    Example Context:  
    Question: If you flip a coin and roll a die, will knowing the coin landed on heads change the probability of rolling a six?
    Student Response: Yes, because knowing the coin landed on heads means a six on the die is more likely.

    b. Misconception: Independence means two events cannot happen at the same time.

    Example Context:  
    Question: Can you roll a die and land on a six at the same time you draw an Ace from a deck of cards?
    Student Response: No, because these events are independent and cannot happen simultaneously.

    c. Misconception: If one event has occurred, it increases the probability of an independent event also occurring.

    Example Context:  
    Question: After rolling a die and getting a four, does this make flipping heads on a coin more likely?
    Student Response: Yes, because it's already been a lucky roll.

    Student Response: Yes, because events must not overlap.

    c. Misconception: The law of total probability calculates the likelihood of individual events, not the union.

    Example Context:  
    Question: Does the law of total probability help find the chance of either event A or B occurring?
    Student Response: No, it only evaluates individual event probabilities.

    d. Misconception: Total probability means summing all probabilities.

    Example Context:  
    Question: Does calculating the total probability involve just adding all given probabilities regardless of conditionality?
    Student Response: Yes, because total means adding everything.

    e. Misconception: Total probability cannot include conditional probabilities.

    Example Context:  
    Question: Does using conditional probabilities violate the application of total probability?

    Example Context:  
    Question: Can joint probability be applied to events that happen one after another?
    Student Response: No, the events must occur simultaneously.

    b. Misconception: Joint probability can be greater than 1.

    Example Context:  
    Question: If two rare events happen together very frequently, can their joint probability exceed 1?
    Student Response: Yes, because of how frequent the combination is.

    c. Misconception: Joint probability is the sum of individual probabilities.

    Example Context:  
    Question: To find the joint probability of A and B happening together, should you simply add their probabilities?
    Student Response: Yes, since both happen, their probabilities should be added up.

    d. Misconception: The joint probability of two independent events is always zero.

    Example Context:  
    Question: Is the joint probability zero for two independent events, like rolling a die and flipping a coin?
    Student Response: Yes, because independent events do not influence each other.

    e. Misconception: Joint probability is found by multiplying the probabilities of events even if they are not independent.

    Example Context:  
    Question: Can you find the joint probability by multiplying two event probabilities regardless of their dependency?
    Student Response: Yes, because multiplication always works for joint probabilities."

*Example Context:*
- **Question:** How do outliers relate to the data set [3, 4, 5, 6, 60] in terms of skew?
- **Student Response:** Outliers make data skewed, so it’s the same thing.

**Misconception 3:** Removing outliers from a data set always gives a more accurate average.

*Example Context:*
- **Question:** If the salary of one millionaire skews the data, when is it better to disregard outliers?
- **Student Response:** It's always better to ignore outliers to find the most accurate mean.

**Misconception 4:** Any value far from the mean is classified as an outlier.

*Example Context:*
- **Question:** Examine the data set [3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 1000]; which do you classify as an outlier and why?
- **Student Response:** Anything distant from the mean like 4 because it’s far from the average is an outlier.

**Misconception 5:** Outliers are irrelevant in a large data set.

*Example Context:*
- **Question:** How influential are outliers in a large data set like [1, 1, ... , 100]?
- **Student Response:** Outliers don’t matter in large sets because other numbers outweigh them."

   d. Question: ""If close similarity exists between expected and observed frequencies, what does it infer?""
      Response: ""It means the variable distribution is likely normal.""

   e. Question: ""What's the relationship between expected frequencies and sample frequencies?""
      Response: ""Expected frequencies are the same as frequencies derived from the sample.""

5. p-Value

   Possible Misconceptions:
   a. A high p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.  
   b. The p-value tells you the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true.  
   c. A p-value of 0.05 means there's a 5% chance the null hypothesis will fail.  
   d. The smaller the p-value, the larger the effect size.  
   e. p-values can be greater than 1.

   Example Context:

   a. Question: ""What does a high p-value indicate about your test results?""
      Response: ""It provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis.""

   b. Question: ""How does the p-value relate to the alternative hypothesis being true?""
      Response: ""It shows the probability that the alternative hypothesis is correct.""

   c. Question: ""If the p-value is 0.05, what does it imply statistically about the null hypothesis?""
      Response: ""It means there's a 5% chance that the null hypothesis might fail.""

   d. Question: ""What does a smaller p-value indicate about the effect you are studying?""
      Response: ""It indicates a larger effect size in the data.""

   e. Question: ""Is it possible for p-value calculations to return a result greater than 1?""
      Response: ""Yes, p-values can exceed 1 in special cases."""
