### 1. Null Hypothesis

**Misconceptions:**

1. **The null hypothesis is what you want to prove true.**

   - **Question:** Explain how scientists use the null hypothesis in hypothesis testing.
   - **Misguided Response:** Scientists use the null hypothesis to prove it is true, as it represents the effect they expect to find.

2. **The null hypothesis accounts for all possible explanations.**

   - **Question:** Consider a study testing if a new drug has an effect compared to a placebo. Describe the role of the null hypothesis in this context.
   - **Misguided Response:** The null hypothesis includes all explanations, like the drug’s unique effect, so it’s comprehensive.

3. **The null hypothesis suggests no relationship means variables are unrelated.**

   - **Question:** A study finds no significant relationship between exercise and weight loss. What does this suggest about the null hypothesis?
   - **Misguided Response:** It supports the idea that exercise has no impact on weight loss because the variables aren’t related.

4. **Rejecting the null hypothesis confirms the alternative.**

   - **Question:** What does rejecting the null hypothesis imply in a scientific study?
   - **Misguided Response:** It definitely confirms the alternative hypothesis.

5. **A null hypothesis is not necessary if the alternative result is expected.**

   - **Question:** Why is it important to include a null hypothesis even if you are confident in an expected outcome?
   - **Misguided Response:** It’s not really necessary since we usually are confident about what is expected to happen.

### 2. Alternative Hypothesis

**Misconceptions:**

1. **The alternative hypothesis is always true if the null is false.**

   - **Question:** Describe what happens if a null hypothesis is rejected. What does this mean for the alternative hypothesis?
   - **Misguided Response:** If the null is false, the alternative hypothesis is definitely true.

2. **The alternative hypothesis implies causation.**

   - **Question:** If a study proposes that a dietary change affects heart health, what does the alternative hypothesis imply?
   - **Misguided Response:** It implies the dietary change directly causes the effect on heart health.

3. **The alternative hypothesis is always more complex than the null.**

   - **Question:** Why might researchers choose a simple alternative hypothesis over a complex one in an experiment?
   - **Misguided Response:** They shouldn’t because the alternative is always more sophisticated and reflects the complexity of real-world situations.

4. **Only one alternative hypothesis exists for any test.**

   - **Question:** In a temperature-influence study on plant growth, is it possible to propose multiple alternative hypotheses? Explain.
   - **Misguided Response:** No, there’s only one possible alternative hypothesis that exists for any study.

2. **Type I and Type II errors are entirely independent.**

   - **Question:** Are Type I and Type II errors related in practice? How does changing the probability of one affect the other?
   - **Misguided Response:** These errors are completely unrelated, and adjusting one doesn’t impact the other.

3. **Reducing the significance level alone can eliminate Type I errors.**

   - **Question:** What are some methods to control Type I errors aside from adjusting the significance level?
   - **Misguided Response:** Simply setting a lower significance level is enough to fully eliminate Type I errors.

4. **Type II error is simply missing a finding and has no consequences.**

   - **Question:** What might be some implications of committing a Type II error in clinical trials?
   - **Misguided Response:** A Type II error only means you miss findings, which doesn’t have any real-world implications.

5. **Type I and Type II error rates are fixed and cannot be adjusted after the study design.**

   - **Question:** How can the design of a study allow for adjustments in Type I and II error rates?
   - **Misguided Response:** Error rates are fixed once the study starts and can’t be adjusted during or after the design phase.

3. **A significance level of 0.05 is arbitrary and universally accepted.**

   - **Question:** Why might researchers choose a significance level other than 0.05 for their studies?
   - **Misguided Response:** There’s no reason to pick anything besides 0.05; it’s a strict convention accepted universally.

4. **Significance level directly equates to real-world relevance.**

   - **Question:** How might the real-world application of results impact the choice or interpretation of a significance level?
   - **Misguided Response:** The significance level tells you the real-world relevance so if results are significant, they’re definitely impactful.

5. **Once set, the significance level cannot be changed during the study.**

   - **Question:** Explain the conditions under which a researcher might change the significance level during an ongoing study.
   - **Misguided Response:** The significance level is cast in stone and can’t be modified once the study begins.

1. **Independent and Dependent Events**
   - Misconception 1: If two events are independent, the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other.
     - Example Context:
       1. Question: Explain how knowing the outcome of one event impacts the probability of another for independent events.
       2. Student Response: ""If Event A happens, it slightly changes how likely Event B is because they are both linked by happening together.""
   
   - Misconception 2: If two events do not share outcomes, they must be independent.
     - Example Context:
       1. Question: Two events, A and B, have no outcomes in common. Discuss whether they can be independent.
       2. Student Response: ""Events A and B don't overlap in outcomes, so this lack of overlap makes them independent.""

   - Misconception 3: Independence implies both events must have the same probability of occurring.
     - Example Context:
       1. Question: Suppose Event A has a probability of 0.2 and Event B has a probability of 0.5. Can these events be independent? Why or why not?
       2. Student Response: ""No, because if they're independent, they'd have to be equally likely to happen.""

   - Misconception 4: Dependent events always occur together.
     - Example Context:
       1. Question: Can you describe a scenario where two dependent events might not both occur next to each other in time?
       2. Student Response: ""If they're dependent, they should always happen one right after the other. If not, they're probably not linked.""

   - Misconception 5: Conditional probability is irrelevant for independent events.
     - Example Context:
       1. Question: In a scenario involving independent events, why might calculating a conditional probability still be meaningful?
       2. Student Response: ""It's not meaningful because conditional probability only matters when events are dependent.""

     - Example Context:
       1. Question: How does the Law of Total Probability apply when events have different probabilities of occurring?
       2. Student Response: ""It doesn’t apply unless all parts are just as likely because it averages outcomes.""

   - Misconception 2: This law only holds if events are independent.
     - Example Context:
       1. Question: Discuss how the Law of Total Probability can be used with dependent events.
       2. Student Response: ""It’s meant for independents as it looks at separate chances adding together, not linked events.""

   - Misconception 3: It’s usable only when an event can occur in precisely two ways.
     - Example Context:
       1. Question: Can the Law of Total Probability be applied to situations involving multiple ways an event can occur?
       2. Student Response: ""It's restricted to two situations; more than that would complicate its sum.""

   - Misconception 4: The Law of Total Probability recalculates the original probabilities of events.
     - Example Context:
       1. Question: Does applying the Law of Total Probability alter the initial probabilities of the individual events? Explain.
       2. Student Response: ""It changes initial probabilities because it sums over all options.""

   - Misconception 5: The addition of probabilities in the Law of Total Probability applies only to mutually exclusive events.
     - Example Context:
       1. Question: Can the Law of Total Probability include non-mutually exclusive events in its calculations? Why?
       2. Student Response: ""No, because if events overlap, you can't just add without double-counting.""

     - Example Context:
       1. Question: Explain how a probability tree might help in understanding dependent events.
       2. Student Response: ""Trees are best for independents by showing clear split paths. For dependencies, other methods suit better.""

   - Misconception 2: All branches in a probability tree must have equal probability.
     - Example Context:
       1. Question: Consider a probability tree where not all branches have equal chances. How do you interpret it?
       2. Student Response: ""The tree won’t work right unless every option off one branch is equally likely.""

   - Misconception 3: Tree diagrams only reflect probabilities, not outcomes.
     - Example Context:
       1. Question: How might outcomes be represented alongside probabilities in a tree diagram?
       2. Student Response: ""A tree just maps probable paths, so noting outcomes might confuse it.""

   - Misconception 4: Reaching the end of a branch means an event definitely occurred.
     - Example Context:
       1. Question: What does reaching the end of a branch in a probability tree signify about event certainty?
       2. Student Response: ""Being at the branch end means the event is certain to happen.""

   - Misconception 5: The final probabilities at the ends of branches are computed by adding the probabilities along the path.
     - Example Context:
       1. Question: When calculating probabilities using a tree structure, how should you correctly determine the probability at a branch's end?
       2. Student Response: ""You add up the branch probabilities because they build as the path extends."""

2. **Within-Subjects Design**
3. **Sphericity**
4. **Mixed-Model Analysis**
5. **Assumptions of Repeated Measures**

### 1. Repeated Measures ANOVA

**Misconceptions:**

a. Repeated Measures ANOVA is interchangeable with regular ANOVA.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** Can you explain how the analysis of variance (ANOVA) differs when applied to repeated measures as opposed to a standard one-way ANOVA?  
     **Student Response:** In a repeated measures ANOVA, we just use a regular ANOVA but apply it multiple times for each person, which makes the repeated measures ANOVA the same as running multiple one-way ANOVAs.

b. It does not take into account the correlation between repeated measures.
   
   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** How does repeated measures ANOVA account for the data collected from the same participants over multiple time points?  
     **Student Response:** It doesn't really account for the repeated measures; it just averages them separately like independent measurements.

c. It can be used for between-subjects comparisons only.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** If we wanted to compare performance over different time points for the same subjects, is repeated measures ANOVA suitable? Why or why not?  
     **Student Response:** Repeated measures ANOVA is more for comparing different groups rather than the same subjects across time points.

d. The number of levels must be equal across all factors.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** Suppose we have a study with differing numbers of time points for some subjects, can we still apply repeated measures ANOVA? How would that look?  
     **Student Response:** Repeated measures ANOVA requires that all groups have the same number of levels in the factors, so it wouldn't work if they are different.

e. It does not require assumptions to be met.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** While setting up a repeated measures ANOVA, what should you check for regarding the data before proceeding with the analysis?  
     **Student Response:** The repeated measures ANOVA doesn't have assumptions like normal ANOVA, so we don't need to check any assumptions before using it.

### 2. Within-Subjects Design

**Misconceptions:**

a. Within-subjects designs do not consider the effect of time on responses.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** Can you discuss how time factors into a within-subjects study design?  
     **Student Response:** Within-subjects designs don't really take the passage of time into account; they just measure changes within subjects irrespective of the timing.

b. Randomization is not necessary.
   
   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** How should randomization be approached in a within-subjects experiment?  
     **Student Response:** Randomization isn't important for within-subjects designs since we are focusing on differences within the same individuals.

c. It does not require counterbalancing.
   
   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** When would counterbalancing be necessary in a within-subjects design and why?  
     **Student Response:** There’s no real need for counterbalancing in within-subject designs since the design controls for individual participant differences.

d. It automatically controls for all forms of participant variability.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** How do within-subjects designs address variability among participants?  
     **Student Response:** Within-subjects automatically controls for any participant variability because they’re all compared to themselves.

e. The results are always more reliable than between-subject designs.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** What considerations might affect the reliability of a within-subjects design compared to a between-subjects design?  
     **Student Response:** Within-subject designs are inherently more reliable than between-subjects designs because each participant acts as their control.

---

### 3. Sphericity

**Misconceptions:**

a. Sphericity is the same as homogeneity of variance.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** How may a violation of sphericity affect repeated measures ANOVA and how is it different from homogeneity of variance?  
     **Student Response:** Sphericity is just like homogeneity of variance, so as long as variances are equal, sphericity is not an issue.

b. It is only applicable to between-subjects designs.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** In which scenarios would you check for the assumption of sphericity, and why?  
     **Student Response:** Sphericity is a concern mainly in between-subjects designs because we need to ensure that those groups are treated equivalently.

c. It is automatically met in small sample sizes.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** Explain whether sample size impacts the assumption of sphericity and why this might matter.  
     **Student Response:** With small samples, we can assume sphericity will always be met because fewer subjects mean lesser chances of variability.

d. If violated, analysis is invalid and cannot proceed.
   
   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** What steps should be taken if the assumption of sphericity is violated in a repeated measures ANOVA?  
     **Student Response:** If sphericity is violated, analysis cannot continue as the results would all be invalid.

e. Correcting for sphericity changes the means.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** Discuss the impact of applying corrections for sphericity violations on the results of a repeated measures ANOVA.  
     **Student Response:** When we correct for sphericity violations, it alters the means of our measurements to make them fit.

### 4. Mixed-Model Analysis

**Misconceptions:**

a. Mixed-models only handle random effects.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** How do mixed-models incorporate different types of effects into their analysis?  
     **Student Response:** Mixed-models only account for random effects, they don't deal with fixed effects at all.

b. They are only suitable for complex designs.
   
   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** For which type of experimental designs would you prefer a mixed-model analysis?  
     **Student Response:** Mixed-models are only useful for very complex studies, so simpler designs don’t really benefit from using them.

c. They require equal sample sizes across groups.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** Can you discuss the flexibility of mixed-models in terms of accommodating sample size variations?  
     **Student Response:** Mixed-models require each group in the study to have the same sample size, otherwise, they wouldn't work correctly.

d. They automatically assume sphericity.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** How does mixed-model analysis address the assumption of sphericity compared to traditional repeated measures ANOVA?  
     **Student Response:** Mixed-models assume sphericity by default, which makes them easier because we don’t have to test for it.

e. Results cannot be interpreted like those from ANOVA.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** How would you compare the interpretability of results obtained from mixed-model analysis and ANOVA?  
     **Student Response:** Results from mixed-models can't be interpreted like ANOVA results because the methods are fundamentally different.

---

### 5. Assumptions of Repeated Measures

**Misconceptions:**

a. Normality of data is not necessary.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** Why is it important to consider the normality of the data in repeated measures, and what might happen if this assumption is violated?  
     **Student Response:** You don’t really need normal data for repeated measures since all the analysis takes place within individuals.

b. Independence of observations does not apply.
   
   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** Can you explain the relevance of the independence of observations in repeated measures ANOVA?  
     **Student Response:** Independence isn’t an issue in repeated measures because we look at the same subject over time, which naturally connects the data.

c. Missing data have severe effects, making analysis invalid.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** How should missing data be handled in repeated measures analysis, and why?  
     **Student Response:** If we have any missing data, the whole analysis is invalidated because repeated measures need complete datasets.

d. Homogeneity of variance cannot be checked.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** Discuss how the assumptions of homogeneity of variance are considered within repeated measures analysis.  
     **Student Response:** Homogeneity of variance isn’t something we can check in repeated measures, so we just have to assume it exists.

e. No adjustment is possible for violations of assumptions.

   - **Context:**  
     **Question:** If the assumptions of a repeated measures ANOVA are violated, what strategies can be employed to address this?  
     **Student Response:** Once assumptions are violated, there’s nothing we can do to adjust the analysis; it would be invalid.

    1. Question: ""If you obtain a small p-value from your test, what does this indicate about the null hypothesis?""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""It shows that there is a low probability that the null hypothesis is true.""

- Misconception 2: A high p-value is strong evidence for the null hypothesis.
  - Example Context:
    1. Question: ""What does a high p-value indicate about your data and the null hypothesis?""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""A high p-value means there is strong evidence that the null hypothesis is correct.""

- Misconception 3: P-values do not depend on sample size.
  - Example Context:
    1. Question: ""Would you expect the p-value to change if you increase the sample size while keeping the observed proportions the same, and why?""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""The p-value wouldn’t change because it reflects the strength of evidence and isn’t affected by sample size.""

- Misconception 4: A p-value of 0.05 means there is a 5% chance the null hypothesis is true.
  - Example Context:
    1. Question: ""Interpret a p-value of 0.05 in the context of a hypothesis test.""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""It means there is a 5% chance that the null hypothesis is true given the data.""

- Misconception 5: A p-value less than 0.05 automatically proves the alternative hypothesis.
  - Example Context:
    1. Question: ""What does obtaining a p-value of 0.04 mean regarding your hypotheses?""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""It conclusively proves that the alternative hypothesis is correct.""

Relevant Topic 4: Expected Frequencies
- Misconception 1: Expected frequencies should match observed frequencies for a good fit.
  - Example Context:
    1. Question: ""What do expected frequencies represent in a goodness-of-fit test, and how should they relate to observed frequencies?""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""Expected frequencies are the same as observed frequencies when the fit is good.""

- Misconception 2: Expected frequencies are calculated using the sample data only.
  - Example Context:
    1. Question: ""How are expected frequencies determined for a chi-square goodness-of-fit test?""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""You calculate expected frequencies directly from your sample data.""

- Misconception 3: Expected frequencies should always be integers.
  - Example Context:
    1. Question: ""If you calculate expected frequencies and find they are not integers, what does this tell you about your analysis?""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""It means I made a mistake in my calculations, as expected frequencies must be whole numbers.""

- Misconception 4: Expected frequencies can be less than 1 without impacting the test results.
  - Example Context:
    1. Question: ""Why is it important to ensure expected frequencies are not too low in a chi-square test?""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""Expected frequencies can be lower than 1 as long as the overall test statistic is calculated correctly.""

- Misconception 5: If some expected frequencies are larger than the observed, the model is incorrect.
  - Example Context:
    1. Question: ""How should differences between expected and observed frequencies impact your view of the model fit?""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""If expected frequencies are greater than observed frequencies, then the model must be incorrect.""

Relevant Topic 5: Degrees of Freedom
- Misconception 1: Degrees of freedom always equal the number of observations.
  - Example Context:
    1. Question: ""Explain how to calculate the degrees of freedom for a chi-square goodness-of-fit test.""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""Degrees of freedom just equate to the number of observations you have.""

- Misconception 2: Degrees of freedom have no impact on the shape of the chi-square distribution.
  - Example Context:
    1. Question: ""Discuss how changing the degrees of freedom affects the chi-square distribution.""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""The degrees of freedom don’t change the shape of the chi-square distribution.""

- Misconception 3: Degrees of freedom in a goodness-of-fit test are always one less than the sample size.
  - Example Context:
    1. Question: ""When performing a goodness-of-fit test, how are degrees of freedom determined relative to the sample size and expected categories?""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""Degrees of freedom are one less than the sample size in all goodness-of-fit tests.""

- Misconception 4: Degrees of freedom are irrelevant for evaluating test significance.
  - Example Context:
    1. Question: ""Why are degrees of freedom important when evaluating the significance of a chi-square test result?""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""Degrees of freedom don’t really matter when checking if a test is significant.""

- Misconception 5: More degrees of freedom always improve your test results.
  - Example Context:
    1. Question: ""How do additional degrees of freedom affect the results and interpretation of a chi-square goodness-of-fit test?""
    2. Sample Student Response: ""Having more degrees of freedom always makes your test results more accurate."""
