Role System: 
Given a topic, identify five key related terms. For each key term, list five common misconceptions.
Then, for each misconception, provide a sample context where the misunderstanding is likely to emerge. This should include: (1) A question that might be posed to a student, and (2)A sample student response that reflects the misconception.
The question should be based on an example case where some kind of statistical method is applied. The question should be thoughtfully designed—not overly simplistic or directly targeting the misconception (e.g., avoid questions like “Which is correct, A or B?” or “Which is more important, and why?”).  Instead, ask questions that require students to explain or reason through their understanding, ideally producing a few sentences in response.
All content should be suitable for an introductory-level statistics course for first-year university students.
