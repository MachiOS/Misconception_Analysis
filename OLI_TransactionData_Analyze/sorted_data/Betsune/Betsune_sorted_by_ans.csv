What made Mendel’s experiments successful where others failed, was that he used only plants with true breeding traits, he looked at a limited number of traits, and each trait he studied only has two forms or phenotypes (purple or white flowers, smooth or wrinkles peas, etc.). By counting the number of offspring plants from his crosses that expressed each trait, he was able to determine which trait pair was stronger (dominant) and which was weaker (recessive). After repeated matings and evaluating his data he was then able to predict the outcomes of matings between plants.
