Substrates are molecules that bind to an enzyme. For any given enzyme, one or more specific substrate molecules will bind to that enzyme. Substrates are then converted to product(s) by the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme.",_m3_enzm_substrate_product_SC,_m3_enzm_substrate_product_SC-DIGTq1_A UpdateShortAnswer,"Metabolic pathways consist of an ordered set of chemical reactions that are catalyzed by enzymes. At the heart of metabolism are enzymes. These proteins embrace substrates, quickly generating products. One or more substrates bind to an enzyme‚Äôs active site. As a result, the activation energy is reduced and the reaction proceeds much more quickly than it otherwise would. Without enzymes, metabolism would grind to a halt. Furthermore, the structural characteristics of enzymes allow the regulation of their function, thus allowing the regulation of the metabolic pathways they participate in.",89,25.923076923076923

It is a good idea for obese or overweight people to lose weight. Excess body fat can harm their health or interfere with their daily activities. However, weight loss should occur slowly in the context of permanent changes to a person’s lifestyle. Very rapid weight loss can be counterproductive, because the pounds are likely to pile back on as the person’s metabolism slows and hunger increases.",_m3_long_term_factors_weight_LBD,m3_long_term_factors_weight_LBD_q5_SC_A UpdateShortAnswer,fat people,2,22.266666666666666
