    Question:How does community ecology apply to a problem in your own city or region? Think broadly about all of the different ways that people and nonhuman species interact.
    Answer:There are a huge range of possible correct answers. You may bring up problems with pests in your area: mosquitoes, bedbugs, ticks, cockroaches, rats or mice, or specific insects or plants that have been introduced from different parts of the world. There may be overabundant wildlife, such as geese, gulls, or deer, that are causing problems in your region. Introduced animal species may be a concern. Specific industries such as farming, forestry, fishing, and hunting may be faced with problems because of unstable plant and animal populations in the area. Particular species may be endangered, leading to political controversies or limitations on development. All these and many more issues could be applications of community ecology. If your answer involves interactions between one or more species, it is a good example.
    Student Input:community ecology appies to a problem in my own region by the amout of furtilizer we use in farming and garding. Due to urban runoff tons of furtilizer flows directing into ponds and stream causing a burst of algi growth in waterways, when plants all the sudden start growing at such extreme rates it creats a blanket of green over the top of the river ot pond cousing the native plants growing at the bottom to die due to lack of sunlight. This sets off a nasty chain of events cauing the fish to die due to the algi taking up so much space, because of that the birds and other wildlife that use those fish as a major food source either starve or find a new food sourc causing them to have an impact on a community they are not supposed to be apart of.

    Student Input:Within Philadelphia, the Schuylkill river is plagued by human contamination as it is so close to the city and is a popular tourist destination that attracts many people that pollute the water source. The river community specifically has interactions among fish, insects, and other waterborne creatures however, birds also utilize the fish as a food source. The polluted water source and diseased fish result in negative effects to the birds health. Overfishing in the area can reduce the aquatic population reflecting poorly on commercial fishing enterprises and bird populations. The fish consume garbage left by humans and as a result, become unhealthy. The interactions between humans and non-human species in this community has a negative result as pollution and unhealthy animals result in degraded species richness and sustainability.

    Student Input:I actually live about 200 feet outside of Valley Forge National Park, so I see, firsthand, the interactions of communities within that ecosystem. Specifically, high deer populations over the recent years- caused primarily by humans eradicating deer predators- has caused severe damage to both the health of deer and to the survival of plant species. This, in turn, has limited the size of an endangered owl species. Humans, as a result, began hunting deer (my family, because we live so close to the park, received a notice that rangers would be sharpshooting) in order to decrease their population.

    Student Input:Community ecology can be applied to my own region when looking at the consequences of fracking and how it negatively affects different species of animals as well as the environment. Fracking is a method of extracting oil by fracturing rock using pressurized liquid. Doing so greatly disturbs the wildlife such as sensitive birds. In addition, it also poses the risk for contamination in the surrounding areas. In Pennsylvania, many fish are affected by contaminated rivers as a result of fracking.

    Student Input:In my region there are a lot of deer because of many small forests across the region. These deer have caused problems such as eating plant life outside of houses, car accidents, and much more. The former gives deer a source of food which it needs and keeps them alive for a longer period of time, while the later kills or injures many animals as well as inconveniencing the human by forcing them to pay the damages.

    Student Input:Community ecology is especially relevant in the growing suburbs in Pennsylvania. As the suburbs and development grows, species die out and are forced to move. In turn, the species richness is decreased. The community ecology of the suburbs is highly polarized between humans and other species. Humans greatly effect of the community ecology of the species surrounding them while humans are relatively unaffected by other species

    Student Input:The community ecology can be applied to the interaction between humans and animals. For example, a recent study found that pesticides contained chemicals that causes cancer. Humans use pesticide to kill pests (which reduces the species richness) but also affected their lives (also lowers the species richness) because the crops contains the pesticide. Also, mosquitos are overpopulated and contain viruses such as Zika.

    Question:How does community ecology apply to a problem in your own city or region? Think broadly about all of the different ways that people and nonhuman species interact.
    Answer:There are a huge range of possible correct answers. You may bring up problems with pests in your area: mosquitoes, bedbugs, ticks, cockroaches, rats or mice, or specific insects or plants that have been introduced from different parts of the world. There may be overabundant wildlife, such as geese, gulls, or deer, that are causing problems in your region. Introduced animal species may be a concern. Specific industries such as farming, forestry, fishing, and hunting may be faced with problems because of unstable plant and animal populations in the area. Particular species may be endangered, leading to political controversies or limitations on development. All these and many more issues could be applications of community ecology. If your answer involves interactions between one or more species, it is a good example.
    Student Input:Yes because a lot of the time the vegetation and animals that live in the area are going to get killed, which destroys community richness. For example, deers and rodents like rats and mouse can be killed on roads.

    Question:How does community ecology apply to a problem in your own city or region? Think broadly about all of the different ways that people and nonhuman species interact.
    Answer:There are a huge range of possible correct answers. You may bring up problems with pests in your area: mosquitoes, bedbugs, ticks, cockroaches, rats or mice, or specific insects or plants that have been introduced from different parts of the world. There may be overabundant wildlife, such as geese, gulls, or deer, that are causing problems in your region. Introduced animal species may be a concern. Specific industries such as farming, forestry, fishing, and hunting may be faced with problems because of unstable plant and animal populations in the area. Particular species may be endangered, leading to political controversies or limitations on development. All these and many more issues could be applications of community ecology. If your answer involves interactions between one or more species, it is a good example.
    Student Input:The constuction of new buildings over lands where animals used to nest.

    Question:Ionic compounds dissolve and ionic bonds are broken in water. Why do you think water can separate ions and break ionic bonds?
    Answer:Ionic bonds involve charges interacting with each other. If water is added to an ionic compound (such as NaCl), the positively charged Na atoms are surrounded by water molecules with the oxygen (which have a slight negative charge) closest to the Na + . The negatively charged Cl is also surrounded by water molecules. In this case, the hydrogen atoms (which have a slight positive charge) are closest to the Cl - The water molecules surround each ion and disrupt the ionic bonds in this way.
    Student Input:The slightly negative charged oxygen would attract the slightly positive charged atom in the ionic compound; the slightly positive charged hydrogen would attract the slighty negative charged atom in the ionic compound. Thus, the ionic compound dissolves.

ID:79 ====================================	
    Question:Ionic compounds dissolve and ionic bonds are broken in water. Why do you think water can separate ions and break ionic bonds?
    Answer:Ionic bonds involve charges interacting with each other. If water is added to an ionic compound (such as NaCl), the positively charged Na atoms are surrounded by water molecules with the oxygen (which have a slight negative charge) closest to the Na + . The negatively charged Cl is also surrounded by water molecules. In this case, the hydrogen atoms (which have a slight positive charge) are closest to the Cl - The water molecules surround each ion and disrupt the ionic bonds in this way.
    Student Input:Since water is polar, the substance that's being dissolved has to be polar or charged ionic compound. The positive pole of the water molecule pulls the anion and the negative pole of the molecule pulls the cation of the compound, thus breaking the the...

    Question:Ionic compounds dissolve and ionic bonds are broken in water. Why do you think water can separate ions and break ionic bonds?
    Answer:Ionic bonds involve charges interacting with each other. If water is added to an ionic compound (such as NaCl), the positively charged Na atoms are surrounded by water molecules with the oxygen (which have a slight negative charge) closest to the Na + . The negatively charged Cl is also surrounded by water molecules. In this case, the hydrogen atoms (which have a slight positive charge) are closest to the Cl - The water molecules surround each ion and disrupt the ionic bonds in this way.
    Student Input:because when an ionic compound like salt or NaCl are added into water, the Na ion has a positive charge and and the O in water has a slight negative charge, so they are attracted to each other. and vice versa, the Cl has a negative charge and the H in...

    Question:Ionic compounds dissolve and ionic bonds are broken in water. Why do you think water can separate ions and break ionic bonds?
    Answer:Ionic bonds involve charges interacting with each other. If water is added to an ionic compound (such as NaCl), the positively charged Na atoms are surrounded by water molecules with the oxygen (which have a slight negative charge) closest to the Na + . The negatively charged Cl is also surrounded by water molecules. In this case, the hydrogen atoms (which have a slight positive charge) are closest to the Cl - The water molecules surround each ion and disrupt the ionic bonds in this way.
    Student Input:Water is polar. It is a great solvent, but substances that water dissolves must be either polar or charged ionic compounds, made from negatively and positively charged atoms. Polar water attracts polar molecules and ions and pushes out non-polar and non-charged substances.  When we try to dissolve an ionic compound by stirring it in water, the positive poles of the water molecules are attracted to the anions, while the negative poles of other water molecules are attracted to the cations, so the polar water molecules "pull" the ions out of a crystal. As a result of these interactions, the ionic bonds eventually break and ions are released into the water. When the salt is dissolved, every ion is surrounded by water molecules, creating a kind of concentric shells of polar water molecules centered around the ions. (They also look like petals of a daisy). This process is called "hydration."

In this case, the hydrogen atoms (which have a slight positive charge) are closest to the Cl - The water molecules surround each ion and disrupt the ionic bonds in this way.
    Student Input:Ionic compounds break and ionic bonds break in water because of the partially positive charge on the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule, and the partially negative charge on the oxygen atom. The partial charge on the hydrogen atoms are able to break down ionic bonds when the partially negative ions are attracted to the partially positive hydrogen atoms.

    Question:Ionic compounds dissolve and ionic bonds are broken in water. Why do you think water can separate ions and break ionic bonds?
    Answer:Ionic bonds involve charges interacting with each other. If water is added to an ionic compound (such as NaCl), the positively charged Na atoms are surrounded by water molecules with the oxygen (which have a slight negative charge) closest to the Na + . The negatively charged Cl is also surrounded by water molecules. In this case, the hydrogen atoms (which have a slight positive charge) are closest to the Cl - The water molecules surround each ion and disrupt the ionic bonds in this way.
    Student Input:The polarity and partial charges of atoms in water molecules are able to pull at the atoms in ionic compounds to dissociate those bonds and result in the dissolving of the compound.

    Question:Mangrove forest, Dominican Republic. Mangrove forests are a common ecosystem along tropical coasts. Mangrove trees grow in shallow salty or brackish (partly fresh) water. The stilt-like roots form a tough interwoven mat. Photo by Anton Bielousov. Dominican republic Los Haitises mangroves CC BY-SA 3.0 Mangrove forests like the one shown in the photo are common along sea coasts and at river mouths in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. Tough and complex, they can withstand storm surges and tsunami waves without washing away. Organic debris settles among the roots and gets buried in muck. Over time, the growing trees and the muck store a significant amount of carbon. Mangroves are a key habitat for spawning and early growth of a variety of fish and shellfish species. The wood is used for firewood and charcoal production in some areas and scientists are now exploring potential medicinal uses for the plants. Mangrove forests are cleared for coastal development and to make room for shrimp farms and other human activities. According to one estimate, 20 percent of the world‚Äôs mangrove forests were lost between 1980 and 2010. Based on the information above and perhaps on your own knowledge or reasoning, list three benefits to humans that are provided by intact mangrove forests.
    Answer:Mangroves stabilize coastlines, potentially helping to protect villages and cities from tropical storms or tsunami waves. Mangroves also help make air breathable and soak up pollutants. They add oxygen to the air and remove carbon dioxide; some of the carbon is stored long-term in the muck beneath the trees. They may also help to remove contaminants from water. Mangroves help sustain fish and shellfish that provide us with seafood; they are also a direct source of wood. Mangroves may one day supply us with medicinal compounds. And they are beautiful, providing a setting for recreational activities like kayaking.
    Student Input:Humans are able to utilize the mangrove forests in a number of ways that when considered clearly outweigh the surface benefits from removing them. Using the biodiversity in mangrove forests as a kind of biomedical database is a crucial necessity as we continue to search for cures to diseases as well as find different care solutions for varying ailments. These forests are also crucial to the ecosystems that they are part of serving as vital habitat areas for various fish and shellfish species. They are also a type of biological levy in that they can withstand harsh weather events and in doing so lessen the damage to any developed property beyond them.

    Question:Mangrove forest, Dominican Republic. Mangrove forests are a common ecosystem along tropical coasts. Mangrove trees grow in shallow salty or brackish (partly fresh) water. The stilt-like roots form a tough interwoven mat. Photo by Anton Bielousov. Dominican republic Los Haitises mangroves CC BY-SA 3.0 Mangrove forests like the one shown in the photo are common along sea coasts and at river mouths in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. Tough and complex, they can withstand storm surges and tsunami waves without washing away. Organic debris settles among the roots and gets buried in muck. Over time, the growing trees and the muck store a significant amount of carbon. Mangroves are a key habitat for spawning and early growth of a variety of fish and shellfish species. The wood is used for firewood and charcoal production in some areas and scientists are now exploring potential medicinal uses for the plants. Mangrove forests are cleared for coastal development and to make room for shrimp farms and other human activities. According to one estimate, 20 percent of the world‚Äôs mangrove forests were lost between 1980 and 2010. Based on the information above and perhaps on your own knowledge or reasoning, list three benefits to humans that are provided by intact mangrove forests.
    Answer:Mangroves stabilize coastlines, potentially helping to protect villages and cities from tropical storms or tsunami waves. Mangroves also help make air breathable and soak up pollutants. They add oxygen to the air and remove carbon dioxide; some of the carbon is stored long-term in the muck beneath the trees. They may also help to remove contaminants from water. Mangroves help sustain fish and shellfish that provide us with seafood; they are also a direct source of wood. Mangroves may one day supply us with medicinal compounds.

    Question:Mangrove forest, Dominican Republic. Mangrove forests are a common ecosystem along tropical coasts. Mangrove trees grow in shallow salty or brackish (partly fresh) water. The stilt-like roots form a tough interwoven mat. Photo by Anton Bielousov. Dominican republic Los Haitises mangroves CC BY-SA 3.0 Mangrove forests like the one shown in the photo are common along sea coasts and at river mouths in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. Tough and complex, they can withstand storm surges and tsunami waves without washing away. Organic debris settles among the roots and gets buried in muck. Over time, the growing trees and the muck store a significant amount of carbon. Mangroves are a key habitat for spawning and early growth of a variety of fish and shellfish species. The wood is used for firewood and charcoal production in some areas and scientists are now exploring potential medicinal uses for the plants. Mangrove forests are cleared for coastal development and to make room for shrimp farms and other human activities. According to one estimate, 20 percent of the world‚Äôs mangrove forests were lost between 1980 and 2010. Based on the information above and perhaps on your own knowledge or reasoning, list three benefits to humans that are provided by intact mangrove forests.
    Answer:Mangroves stabilize coastlines, potentially helping to protect villages and cities from tropical storms or tsunami waves. Mangroves also help make air breathable and soak up pollutants. They add oxygen to the air and remove carbon dioxide; some of the carbon is stored long-term in the muck beneath the trees. They may also help to remove contaminants from water. Mangroves help sustain fish and shellfish that provide us with seafood; they are also a direct source of wood. Mangroves may one day supply us with medicinal compounds. And they are beautiful, providing a setting for recreational activities like kayaking.
    Student Input:The intact mangrove forest can provide protection from tsunamis, produce medicinal substances, and provide a breeding ground for organisms.

Because there are some characteristics of life they don‚Äôt possess, viruses are generally not considered to be alive.
    Student Input:I think I would take the side of a virus not being alive. Although they have some similar characteristics to living things they also have many differences. Namely that they do not energize and reproduce without stealing from a host. Also, life grows and clearly viruses don't grow they reproduce by injecting a host. The fact that they don't meet the definition of a cell is another strong argument, if the cell is the basic unit of all living things, a virus would have to have all the characteristics in order to be called living.

Because there are some characteristics of life they don‚Äôt possess, viruses are generally not considered to be alive.
    Student Input:I do not think that viruses count as being alive since they do not contain the proper tools for reproduction themselves. Viruses seem to be no more than containers of information that get into a living cell and transfer the bluprints to make more of the harmful virus into those cells that do have the means for reproduction. I feel like having the means of reproductions within yourself, even though facts 2 & 3 do not require this, are important parts of the definition, which is why I don't consider viruses as being alive.

    Student Input:No, I do not think that viruses are alive. I do not think that viruses are alive because they do not contain all of the criteria living things must have. They do not use their own energy and raw materials to survive, they merely use other cells energy and raw materials. Also, viruses do not grow.

Because there are some characteristics of life they don‚Äôt possess, viruses are generally not considered to be alive.
    Student Input:Viruses are not alive, while they do reproduce, they don't grow. Nor do they use their own energy, Viruses need to hijack another cell in order to use that cells energy. Not to mention Viruses are not by definition cells. Cells are considered the first level in the levels of organization to be considered as showing signs of life.

Although they evolve rapidly and they develop and reproduce, they are unable to do this without a host, they do not grow, they don't meet the definition of a cell, and they can't use energy and raw material to grow. Although they are able to use a host to survive, they cannot do it on their own. Because of this, I do not think they are alive.

Because there are some characteristics of life they don‚Äôt possess, viruses are generally not considered to be alive.
    Student Input:I would consider Viruses to be alive. The reason why is that although they dont use their own energy to grow or reproduce, they have intention to grow or reproduce.  They have a drive to do something. Consider a nonbiotic thing like a rock. A rock doesnt have intention. It just sits there. It doesn't really interact with the enviroment. Viruses, on the other hand, affect the enviroment around them.

    Student Input:No, viruses are not living. They do pertain to many qualities of life, but in order to be living you have to embody the 6 components of life- and viruses do not do so. They cannot maintain homeostasis because they are not cells nor do they contain cells, they only use energy that they steal from actual cells, they do not grow or develop, and they cheat reproduction.

Because there are some characteristics of life they don‚Äôt possess, viruses are generally not considered to be alive.
    Student Input:Viruses are not alive. The reason is that viruses don't actually use energy and raw materials to grow and reproduce by itself, rather it needs to rely on a host to function. Also, Viruses aren't actually a cell because some viruses don't have a membrane structure, but the others that do, they lack other things found inside cells. Meaning they are not defined as cells.

    Student Input:Viruses are not alive because they do not meet all five characteristics of life... they can not reproduce on without a host cell to use energy/raw material to do so, as well they lack the defining characteristic of a membrane so they are not cells. This means they fail to meet the characteristic saying that all livings things are made of one or more cells.

Because there are some characteristics of life they don‚Äôt possess, viruses are generally not considered to be alive.
    Student Input:I do not think viruses are alive. In order to be considered alive, you must meet every characteristic of life and viruses don't. Viruses don't use energy or raw materials to grow and reproduce. They need help from the host cell to reproduce, but they don't grow. Viruses also don't meet the definition of a cell which is the fundamental unit of life.

Because there are some characteristics of life they don‚Äôt possess, viruses are generally not considered to be alive.
    Student Input:No viruses are not alive because first, they don't have a defined cell and need a host to feed off. Viruses need the hosts DNA to grow and reproduce. One thing they make them seem alive is that they can evolve into another virus which seems like something a plant does or if two different dogs breed.

    Answer:Viruses lack some of the characteristics of life. For example, they do not directly use raw materials to replicate, and they don‚Äôt grow at all. They also are not composed of cells. Because there are some characteristics of life they don‚Äôt possess, viruses are generally not considered to be alive.
    Student Input:I don't believe that viruses are necessarily alive; they don't have the same features as a cell, for example they have a protein layer as a boundary, and they don't build together to create life on their own. Viruses only attack other living things.

    Question:What is the difference between a community and an ecosystem? Explain in your own words.
    Answer:A community is a collection of interacting populations that live together in an area: it is only made up of living organisms. An ecosystem includes the community, but it also includes non-living or abiotic factors like weather, sunlight, rocks, soil, etc. Both might cover exactly the same geographic area; one is not physically bigger than the other. The ecosystem just includes a different and broader range of factors and processes.
    Student Input:The community level is an area made up of different groups of living things. A community focuses on how the living things interact among themselves apart from their environment. An ecosystem, the next highest level, has a more broad perspective of study, focusing not only on the interactions between living things, but also on how non-living and environmental factors influence living things and how they survive and communicate. Although communities and ecosystems could be in the same area, an ecosystem has a larger field of study as it includes the interactions between living and non-living factors.

The ecosystem just includes a different and broader range of factors and processes.
    Student Input:What differentiates a community and an ecosystem is that the latter describes a similar area on a much larger scale. A community refers to the various populations in a specific region and how these different species of both animals and plants interact with each other. Meanwhile, an ecosystem sees these interactions, but also takes into account how all the non-living factors such as climate and landscape can affect the different populations and influence each other as well.

    Question:Scientists turn to model organisms ‚Äî species that are easy to keep in the lab and have been studied extensively ‚Äî and use them as study subjects. Rats and mice, for example, are key to medical research. Dozens of mouse and rat strains have been specifically maintained as research subjects because they reliably develop problems like obesity, diabetes, or behavioral disorders such as addiction. How could research on mice or rats help answer our medical research questions ‚Äî questions that are, after all, about humans?
    Answer:We can test out medicines, for example, by giving them to diabetic mice. Or we can figure out what causes a health problem by doing experiments on mice that wouldn‚Äôt be possible with people. Such research is useful because mice and people are related by ancestry. We have similar organs, cells, and molecules. Something we learn in mice might apply directly to people, or it might at least point us in the right direction for further study. To learn more: Genetic Science Learning Center
    Student Input:Lab rats/ mice have some of the same behavioral and physiolagical characteristics as humans and in testing the rats, researchers can compare the consequences of the lab rats to the humans without harming humans. This is because of the common ancestry....

    Question:Scientists turn to model organisms ‚Äî species that are easy to keep in the lab and have been studied extensively ‚Äî and use them as study subjects. Rats and mice, for example, are key to medical research. Dozens of mouse and rat strains have been specifically maintained as research subjects because they reliably develop problems like obesity, diabetes, or behavioral disorders such as addiction. How could research on mice or rats help answer our medical research questions ‚Äî questions that are, after all, about humans?
    Answer:We can test out medicines, for example, by giving them to diabetic mice. Or we can figure out what causes a health problem by doing experiments on mice that wouldn‚Äôt be possible with people. Such research is useful because mice and people are related by ancestry. We have similar organs, cells, and molecules. Something we learn in mice might apply directly to people, or it might at least point us in the right direction for further study. To learn more: Genetic Science Learning Center
    Student Input:Research on mice or rats can help answer our medical research questions because they are similar to humans in many ways. By testing on animals such as these, scientists get an idea of what problems may arise from their products when used by humans, and work towards solutions to prevent these problems. This way, no humans have to be harmed during the process and researchers can predict any problems that may arise if humans were to use their product.

    Student Input:The research that they complete on mice or rats would help find solutions to our medical research questions since they have similarities to a human's body. They could just try to see if it would help increase or solve problems in human's health since they have tested it on animals. But there is a negative in testing in the animals because it might not have the same reactions on a human.

    Question:Scientists turn to model organisms ‚Äî species that are easy to keep in the lab and have been studied extensively ‚Äî and use them as study subjects. Rats and mice, for example, are key to medical research. Dozens of mouse and rat strains have been specifically maintained as research subjects because they reliably develop problems like obesity, diabetes, or behavioral disorders such as addiction. How could research on mice or rats help answer our medical research questions ‚Äî questions that are, after all, about humans?
    Answer:We can test out medicines, for example, by giving them to diabetic mice. Or we can figure out what causes a health problem by doing experiments on mice that wouldn‚Äôt be possible with people. Such research is useful because mice and people are related by ancestry. We have similar organs, cells, and molecules. Something we learn in mice might apply directly to people, or it might at least point us in the right direction for further study.

    Question:Based on your estimates above, what can you say about deer density in Valley Forge NHP in 2008? Was it typical of the region or consistent with past values?
    Answer:Deer density was clearly very high at Valley Forge NHP in 2008. It was unusually high for Pennsylvania, at more than 10 times the statewide average. It was also almost 10 times higher than it was in 1985 within the same area. The raw numbers are hard to interpret but by calculating densities we can make more useful comparisons.
    Student Input:There was exponential growth within deer populations in Valley Forge NHP from 1985 to 2008. This growth was not typical of the region or consistent with past values as the extreme growth displays how fast the deer population in Valley Forge have multiplied.

In 2007, the state wide population about about 9 deer/km2. Since, Valley Forge NHP has a very large population of deer, it seems to be very accurate that the deer/km2 was much higher,117, than the past years state average.

    Question:Why do you think the deer population did not follow the path predicted by the exponential growth model?
    Answer:The exponential model assumes that rates of birth, death, and increase all remain constant over time. It also assumes that there is no immigration or emigration. In reality, none of these assumptions is likely to be true. In particular, birth rates may have declined in the park as it grew more crowded; studies have found that yearling (young) females in the park have lower birth rates than those outside the park. Weather and other unpredictable conditions may also have led to higher-than-average death rates in some years, and deer may have left the park to find less crowded conditions elsewhere. You may not have thought of all these reasons, but we hope you identified the basic problem: the model did not account for the reality that birth, death, emigration, and immigration rates all might change over time.

You may not have thought of all these reasons, but we hope you identified the basic problem: the model did not account for the reality that birth, death, emigration, and immigration rates all might change over time.
    Student Input:A model of constant growth is not sustainable as it does not consider the fact that birth, death, immigration, and emigration rates fluctuate over time and conditions. Multiple factors that effect the deer population could be overhunting, a lack of food, loss of habitat, and extreme weather. However, multiplying populations tend to fluctuate in their breeding due to environmental factors and as shown in early 2000s, there was a sharp decrease in population only to have a rebound increase in the late 2000s as conditions for repopulation bettered.

    Student Input:In short, the four factors of population change would not have remained constant. If the model was not closed, immigration/emigration (likely more emigration because the population did not grow as much as predicted) could have influenced the deer. Additionally, certain environmental factors could have changed with the turn of the century; specifically, government incentives arose in VFNHP at this time to eliminate over-crowded deer populations and to preserve an endangered species of owl. This would increase the death rate while the birth rate remained constant.

    Student Input:One reason that the deer population did not follow the path predicted by the model could be because there was an inconvenient food supply for the deer. When there was food avaliable the deer population rose, and when there of a shortage of food the population decreased. So due to this inconsistent food source, the deer population could have fluctuated.

    Student Input:The model assumes that the rate of birth and death will stay the same over time which is not accurate.

You may not have thought of all these reasons, but we hope you identified the basic problem: the model did not account for the reality that birth, death, emigration, and immigration rates all might change over time.
    Student Input:The exponential growth model assumes the deer will continue to grow 39% annually, therefore one year of the growth being lower or higher can easily affect the outcome. With births and deaths each year, it is extremely hard for each year to be 39%. The rates of birth and death do not remain constant all the time.

    Question:Why do you think the deer population did not follow the path predicted by the exponential growth model?
    Answer:The exponential model assumes that rates of birth, death, and increase all remain constant over time. It also assumes that there is no immigration or emigration. In reality, none of these assumptions is likely to be true. In particular, birth rates may have declined in the park as it grew more crowded; studies have found that yearling (young) females in the park have lower birth rates than those outside the park. Weather and other unpredictable conditions may also have led to higher-than-average death rates in some years, and deer may have left the park to find less crowded conditions elsewhere. You may not have thought of all these reasons, but we hope you identified the basic problem: the model did not account for the reality that birth, death, emigration, and immigration rates all might change over time.
    Student Input:as more deer were born and the population grew exponentially, the surrounding environment was not able do keep up with said growth, so the resources such as food and shelter were not available to all the deer. Therefore since many deer were not living in suitable conditions for life, the population trend did not increase.

    Student Input:The deer population did not follow the path predicted by the original exponential growth model because it assumed that the birth and death rates would remain constant. It did not account for any external factors either that could have affected deer birth rates. Other factors such as immigration and emigration were also not accounted for.

    Answer:The exponential model assumes that rates of birth, death, and increase all remain constant over time. It also assumes that there is no immigration or emigration. In reality, none of these assumptions is likely to be true. In particular, birth rates may have declined in the park as it grew more crowded; studies have found that yearling (young) females in the park have lower birth rates than those outside the park. Weather and other unpredictable conditions may also have led to higher-than-average death rates in some years, and deer may have left the park to find less crowded conditions elsewhere. You may not have thought of all these reasons, but we hope you identified the basic problem: the model did not account for the reality that birth, death, emigration, and immigration rates all might change over time.
    Student Input:Exponential growth assumes that populations will keep constant rates of births and deaths. Birth rates probably decreased or death rates increased. Some deer might've left the park as well.

In particular, birth rates may have declined in the park as it grew more crowded; studies have found that yearling (young) females in the park have lower birth rates than those outside the park. Weather and other unpredictable conditions may also have led to higher-than-average death rates in some years, and deer may have left the park to find less crowded conditions elsewhere. You may not have thought of all these reasons, but we hope you identified the basic problem: the model did not account for the reality that birth, death, emigration, and immigration rates all might change over time.
    Student Input:There may have been a national disaster or human-made disaster that harmed the environment and the deer population.

    Question:Based on the graph, what is the apparent carrying capacity for deer at Valley Forge NHP? Give an estimate and explain how you chose it.
    Answer:Although the record is not very long and the population was not very stable, the numbers seemed to grow from 1985 to 2000, and then fluctuate around about 1300 deer starting in the early 2000s. Reasonable guesses for a carrying capacity might range from about 1200 to about 1400 deer. The population tended to return toward these values over time.
    Student Input:The apparent carrying capacity for deer at Valley Forge NHP is somewhere between 1200 and 1400 deer. A good estimate would be about 1300 deer. This can also be seen in the graph. The deer population reaches 1400 where i stays the same for some time before dropping to about 1000. From there, it increases drastically, but quickly recedes and reaches the point of about 1300 deer. When the population spiked suddenly, it became unsustainable and the death rate rose before stabilizing once more.

    Answer:Although the record is not very long and the population was not very stable, the numbers seemed to grow from 1985 to 2000, and then fluctuate around about 1300 deer starting in the early 2000s. Reasonable guesses for a carrying capacity might range from about 1200 to about 1400 deer. The population tended to return toward these values over time.
    Student Input:it seems to be around the area of 1100 and 1300. I say this because in the beginning, there is a lot of potential to grow because the population has not reached its carrying capacity, but then it begins to level out at 1100. It still continues to fluctuate in this particular amount, and even when there is a major spike in population growth, it quickly comes back from 1600 to 1300

    Question:In some forests in the Pacific Northwest of North America, vast numbers of salmon swim up streams during annual spawning migrations. They die after spawning, providing food to bears and other wildlife that spend their lives in the forest. Salmon clearly are part of the river and stream communities, but are they part of the forest community as well?
    Answer:Comparison answer: Yes, a community ecologist would probably include the salmon as part of the forest community. The answer depends on how important salmon are to the animals and other organisms that make up the core of the forest community. Studies indicate that the salmon are, in fact, a very important source of food to forest animals and also provide nutrients to streamside plants. You probably did not know about this research, but your answer is a good one if you identified interaction as the key issue: if they interact in any significant way with the populations in the forest, salmon are part of the forest community.

    Student Input:They are part of the forest community as well as the river and stream communities. Similarly to how birds remove fish and react with pond communities, birds also interact with forest communities by traveling to them where they become a food source to the wildlife that lives there. Fish play a large role in sustaining wildlife in the forest, thus making them a part of the community.

Salmon clearly are part of the river and stream communities, but are they part of the forest community as well?
    Answer:Comparison answer: Yes, a community ecologist would probably include the salmon as part of the forest community. The answer depends on how important salmon are to the animals and other organisms that make up the core of the forest community. Studies indicate that the salmon are, in fact, a very important source of food to forest animals and also provide nutrients to streamside plants. You probably did not know about this research, but your answer is a good one if you identified interaction as the key issue: if they interact in any significant way with the populations in the forest, salmon are part of the forest community.
    Student Input:Salmond are indeed part of the forest community as well. Simply put, the salmon provide nourishment for other species(i.e. bears). If the salmon interact favorably with other populations, then the salmon are indeed part of the forest community.

A water soluble protein, if found in a sea of lipid is likely to unfold because the non-polar residues that are in the core of the protein are no longer driven to the core by the hydrophobic effect; they are ‚Äúsolvated‚Äù by the non-polar part of the membrane.
    Student Input:It will not dissolve because crystal forces are competing with hydration forces.

    Question:Compare and contrast natural selection with artificial selection.
    Answer:Natural selection occurs when the environment influences the evolution of a population. In natural selection, those individuals with traits that are better suited to the environment have a higher likelihood of reproducing and passing on their genes to subsequent generations. In comparison, artificial selection is the process by which humans choose individuals with desired traits to be bred with each other. Both types of selection take generations to alter the gene pool and are mechanisms of evolution.

    Question:Describe an example of interdependence among cells within your body.
    Answer:There are many good answers. Your brain cells depend on freshly oxygenated blood flow, so if your lungs or heart stop functioning, your brain cells will die within several minutes. On the other hand, your lungs and heart work partly under the control of signals from your brain. You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow. Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another. This is the core of the ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù concept.

    Question:Describe an example of interdependence among cells within your body.
    Answer:There are many good answers. Your brain cells depend on freshly oxygenated blood flow, so if your lungs or heart stop functioning, your brain cells will die within several minutes. On the other hand, your lungs and heart work partly under the control of signals from your brain. You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow. Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another. This is the core of the ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù concept.
    Student Input:Growth is just an increase in size. In development, structure and function change in an orderly way as an organism passes through its life cycle. An individual's pattern of development is partly determined by genetic instructions. DNA, the molecule of inheritance, encodes proteins and other molecules that build cells and make them work. You can think of genes as "recipes" for proteins. Each cell has a huge library of thousands of recipes in its DNAYour brain cells depend on freshly oxygenated blood flow, so if your lungs or heart stop functioning, your brain cells will die within several minutes.

    Student Input:Development is only an expansion in measure. Being developed, structure and capacity change in an organized path as a living being goes through its life cycle. A person's example of advancement is incompletely dictated by hereditary directions. DNA, the atom of legacy, encodes proteins and different particles that manufacture cells and influence them to work. You can consider qualities "formulas" for proteins. Every cell has a gigantic library of thousands of formulas in its DNA Your cerebrum cells rely upon newly oxygenated blood stream, so if your lungs or heart quit working, your mind cells will pass on inside a few minutes.

    Student Input:An example of interdependence of cells within the body can be the respiratory and circulatory system within the body. All cells in the body require oxygen to live and therefore these systems help circulate this needed component to the cells. If these systems stop working the cells within the body could die from lack of oxygen. Similarly if cells in you body start dying then these systems may not work as efficiently.

    Student Input:If one of my organs suddenly stopped working -- for example, an important vein stopped pumping blood into my heart -- it wouldn't matter what the rest of my body cells are doing; I would most likely die because my body would not receive the nutrients it requires to survive. This example shows interdependence because the cells all need to work together in order to keep me alive.

    Student Input:Your heart is an organ that works in conjunction with your body to provide nutrients (blood and oxygen) to all your extremities to keep you alive. It is your circulatory system. Without your brain informing your lungs to inflate with air or direct air into the chambers of your heart, none of this could happen. They all rely on one another to keep you alive.

    Student Input:So cells make up everything in a human body. For example the heart is an organ containing tissues made of many, many cells meant to work together to keep the heart functioning. If one or two of these cells become sick, or unstable the heart could shut down and if the heart shuts down so do all the cells in a human body.

    Student Input:An example of interdependence among cells in our bodies would be the cell flow to our brains. In order for cells to function properly in your brain it must have enough oxygen in the blood flow. Without oxygen your heart could stop beating, your lungs will collapse and your brain will stop functioning if your body goes through several minutes without air.

    Answer:There are many good answers. Your brain cells depend on freshly oxygenated blood flow, so if your lungs or heart stop functioning, your brain cells will die within several minutes. On the other hand, your lungs and heart work partly under the control of signals from your brain. You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow. Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another. This is the core of the ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù concept.
    Student Input:We need oxygen to breathe and to survive, but our other organs will not survive with a lack of air. At the same time, our brain cells need to be aware of us taking in oxygen, which cannot occur unless the brain is oxygenated.

You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow. Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another. This is the core of the ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù concept.
    Student Input:All of the remaining organs within your body, rely on the heart. Without the heart pumping blood to all the other organs, these organs could not function and you would die.

    Question:Describe an example of interdependence among cells within your body.
    Answer:There are many good answers. Your brain cells depend on freshly oxygenated blood flow, so if your lungs or heart stop functioning, your brain cells will die within several minutes. On the other hand, your lungs and heart work partly under the control of signals from your brain. You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow. Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another. This is the core of the ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù concept.
    Student Input:The heart is needed by many functions of the body because it provides blood cells; the heart also needs the brain to tell it to operate efficiently.

On the other hand, your lungs and heart work partly under the control of signals from your brain. You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow. Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another. This is the core of the ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù concept.
    Student Input:The blood cells rely on the cells in your lungs to get oxygen so the blood cells can enrich your body in oxygen.

    Question:Describe an example of interdependence among cells within your body.
    Answer:There are many good answers. Your brain cells depend on freshly oxygenated blood flow, so if your lungs or heart stop functioning, your brain cells will die within several minutes. On the other hand, your lungs and heart work partly under the control of signals from your brain. You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow. Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another. This is the core of the ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù concept.

    Question:Describe an example of interdependence among cells within your body.
    Answer:There are many good answers. Your brain cells depend on freshly oxygenated blood flow, so if your lungs or heart stop functioning, your brain cells will die within several minutes. On the other hand, your lungs and heart work partly under the control of signals from your brain. You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow. Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another. This is the core of the ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù concept.

    Answer:There are many good answers. Your brain cells depend on freshly oxygenated blood flow, so if your lungs or heart stop functioning, your brain cells will die within several minutes. On the other hand, your lungs and heart work partly under the control of signals from your brain. You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow. Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another. This is the core of the ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù concept.

    Question:Describe an example of interdependence among cells within your body.
    Answer:There are many good answers. Your brain cells depend on freshly oxygenated blood flow, so if your lungs or heart stop functioning, your brain cells will die within several minutes. On the other hand, your lungs and heart work partly under the control of signals from your brain. You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow. Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another. This is the core of the ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù concept.

    Question:Describe an example of interdependence among cells within your body.
    Answer:There are many good answers. Your brain cells depend on freshly oxygenated blood flow, so if your lungs or heart stop functioning, your brain cells will die within several minutes. On the other hand, your lungs and heart work partly under the control of signals from your brain. You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow. Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another. This is the core of the ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù concept.
    Student Input:Your cells all work together collectively to keep your body alive.

    Question:You may have seen television programs that make weight loss into a contest, with the prize going to the contestant who takes off pounds the fastest. You may even have similar incentive programs in your own school, church, or workplace. Are these contests or incentives a good idea?
    Answer:Yes and no. It is a good idea for obese or overweight people to lose weight. Excess body fat can harm their health or interfere with their daily activities. However, weight loss should occur slowly in the context of permanent changes to a person‚Äôs lifestyle. Very rapid weight loss can be counterproductive, because the pounds are likely to pile back on as the person‚Äôs metabolism slows and hunger increases.
    Student Input:I work in healthcare, I also like to work out at the gym. I like long term slow gains as opposed to fast fads. When younger I weighed about 240lbs, when I joined the Marine Corps I was set into a strict workout plan that was closely monitored by Navy personnel that monitor diets. I was 175lbs of mostly muscle when I left boot camp. This was very short term loss of weight. But the output and input were closely monitored, along with that there was a lot of effort placed into exercise that enforced the discipline of what we were doing.

    Question:You may have seen television programs that make weight loss into a contest, with the prize going to the contestant who takes off pounds the fastest. You may even have similar incentive programs in your own school, church, or workplace. Are these contests or incentives a good idea?
    Answer:Yes and no. It is a good idea for obese or overweight people to lose weight. Excess body fat can harm their health or interfere with their daily activities.

We humans are dependent on algae and plants that produce food and oxygen gas, animals we harvest as food, and decomposers that get rid of wastes. They, in turn, may be dependent on us for cultivation (in the case of crop plants), protection, or a supply of food (the helpful bacteria in our sewage treatment plants would starve without us!).

    Student Input:Humans are fully dependent on many organisms for life, such as the microorganisms in our gut, or bees to pollinate plants we use for food. We have domesticated some species and bred them to the point that they are unable to exist outside of being taken care of. Meat birds, for instance, are bred to be so large and fat that they must be artificially inseminated and cannot run or jump to escape predators.

    Student Input:We people are subject to green growth and plants that deliver sustenance and oxygen gas, creatures we gather as nourishment, and decomposers that dispose of squanders. They, thus, might be reliant on us for development, insurance, or a supply of nourishment . You presumably concocted your own particular answer. Did the appropriate response particularly portray how people rely upon alternate species And how alternate species relies upon us.If along these lines, you have a decent handle of relationship.

If so, you‚Äôve got a good grasp of interdependence.
    Student Input:Humans are omnivores, meaning they rely on plants and animals to get food. If either of these groups failed, humans would no longer be able to eat, resulting in starvation and death. Humans are at the top of the food chain, but plants and animals still rely on us to to make sure the earth is still a good place for them to thrive. Because humans can be very disruptive.

    Student Input:Plants breathe the carbon dioxide animals and humans produce and create oxygen that the animals and humans can breathe, creating a cycle. Another example would be cats, they would kill vermin and eat them for food and this would keep vermin away from that area. Humans began keeping cats to keep vermin away and in exchange they cared for the cats with food, shelter, water, etc.

    Answer:Once again, there are lots of possible answers. We humans are dependent on algae and plants that produce food and oxygen gas, animals we harvest as food, and decomposers that get rid of wastes. They, in turn, may be dependent on us for cultivation (in the case of crop plants), protection, or a supply of food (the helpful bacteria in our sewage treatment plants would starve without us!). You probably came up with your own answer. Did the answer specifically describe how humans depend on the other species AND how the other species depends on us? If so, you‚Äôve got a good grasp of interdependence.

    Question:Why is pH regulated in your body? How is the pH of your blood regulated?
    Answer:Cells and living organisms can only function and survive in a very limited pH range. If pH is disrupted, the chemical reactions that enable life stop working. It is therefore an essential part of homeostasis to maintain the appropriate pH balance within a cell/organism. In diabetic ketoacidosis, a wide range of health problems and even death can result due to disruption of the body‚Äôs pH. In healthy people, blood pH is regulated partly through the action of a buffer (bicarbonate).
    Student Input:The pH is regulated in your body because when the body is either too basic or too acidic, it becomes vulnerable to various infections such as bacterial infections. The body can also develop harmful conditions such as Diabetic Ketoacidosis due to lower pH levels in the blood stream. The human body regulates the pH levels of your blood through the use of buffers that either bind to H+ ions or break down bases in order to resist extreme changes in pH.

    Student Input:pH is regulated in the human body for many different reasons including the break down and digestion of foods, keeping us healthy, having healthy skin, etc. pH in our blood is regulated by buffers. When you loose and burn a lot of fat, an acid called Ketone acid is produced. Too much of this acid can cause problems in your body. Your blood acts as a buffer and gets these chemicals out.

    Student Input:PH is regulated by different body process, as explained in the last section there are different acids that can assist in realsing H+ into the blood when bases are found to allow the system to remain in a more acidic ph. By keeping the body more acidic, the body has more natural defense mechanisms and also use the acids to break down foods for energy.

    Answer:Cells and living organisms can only function and survive in a very limited pH range. If pH is disrupted, the chemical reactions that enable life stop working. It is therefore an essential part of homeostasis to maintain the appropriate pH balance within a cell/organism. In diabetic ketoacidosis, a wide range of health problems and even death can result due to disruption of the body‚Äôs pH. In healthy people, blood pH is regulated partly through the action of a buffer (bicarbonate).
    Student Input:to maintain proper acidity. pH in blood is regulated by the breakdown of fatty acids.
