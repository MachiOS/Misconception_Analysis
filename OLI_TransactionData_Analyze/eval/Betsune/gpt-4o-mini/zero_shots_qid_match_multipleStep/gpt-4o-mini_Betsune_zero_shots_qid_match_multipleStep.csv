Explanation: The student input describes interdependence between cell organelles (ribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum), which is a valid example of interdependence. However, the question specifically asks for an example of interdependence among cells within the body, not organelles.

It does not describe how different types of cells rely on each other for proper function or provide a two-way interaction as required for the concept of interdependence.

Explanation: The student's answer accurately mentions that Bill's calorie restriction leads his body to use stored energy, but it overlooks the initial loss of water weight due to glycogen depletion.

Explanation: The student correctly describes that the active site is involved in the catalysis of the enzyme-substrate complex into products.

Simply stating ""they will change"" does not provide enough information regarding the specific nature of the change in hunger and cravings."
