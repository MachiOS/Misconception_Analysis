    Question:What are enzymes, substrate, and product?
    Answer:Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts (make it easier for chemical reactions to occur). Substrates are molecules that bind to an enzyme. For any given enzyme, one or more specific substrate molecules will bind to that enzyme. Substrates are then converted to product(s) by the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme.
    Student Input:Metabolic pathways consist of an ordered set of chemical reactions that are catalyzed by enzymes. At the heart of metabolism are enzymes. These proteins embrace substrates, quickly generating products. One or more substrates bind to an enzyme‚Äö√Ñ√¥s active site. As a result, the activation energy is reduced and the reaction proceeds much more quickly than it otherwise would. Without enzymes, metabolism would grind to a halt. Furthermore, the structural characteristics of enzymes allow the regulation of their function, thus allowing the regulation of the metabolic pathways they participate in.

    Answer:Once again, there are lots of possible answers. We humans are dependent on algae and plants that produce food and oxygen gas, animals we harvest as food, and decomposers that get rid of wastes. They, in turn, may be dependent on us for cultivation (in the case of crop plants), protection, or a supply of food (the helpful bacteria in our sewage treatment plants would starve without us!).

If so, you‚Äôve got a good grasp of interdependence.
    Student Input:A biological system comprises of the considerable number of life forms living inside a characterized zone alongside the abiotic segments of that specific condition. Inside a biological system, creatures communicate with one another in supportive and hurtful manners. A few sorts of creatures assume covering jobs with different species (e.g., six types of oak tree may have comparative, if not indistinguishable, jobs in a woods). Others, in any case, assume interesting and basic jobs that different living beings rely on for their endurance. For instance, in a Colorado woodland, scientists found that a types of sapsucker (a winged creature like a woodpecker) assumed a crucial job in giving settling gaps and food to numerous different species.

    Answer:There are many good answers. Your brain cells depend on freshly oxygenated blood flow, so if your lungs or heart stop functioning, your brain cells will die within several minutes. On the other hand, your lungs and heart work partly under the control of signals from your brain. You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow. Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another. This is the core of the ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù concept.

    Student Input:Two cell organelles that are interdependent are ribosomes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Ribosomes contain RNA and synthesize proteins. Ribosomes are structurally attached the rough endoplasmic reticulum, so obviously they rely on each other. Especially, because the rough E.R. helps process certain proteins at ribosomes. If one organelle existed without the other, neither of them would have a purpose, and are therefore interdependent.

    Question:Describe an example of interdependence among cells within your body.
    Answer:There are many good answers. Your brain cells depend on freshly oxygenated blood flow, so if your lungs or heart stop functioning, your brain cells will die within several minutes. On the other hand, your lungs and heart work partly under the control of signals from your brain. You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow. Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another. This is the core of the ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù concept.

Gradually the rate of weight loss slows down, even though he sticks to the exact same level of calorie intake and exercise each day. Why, with the same calorie intake and activity level, would Bill‚Äôs weight loss slow down as he gets thinner?
    Answer:Bill‚Äôs basal metabolic rate (BMR) ‚Äî the number of calories used just to stay alive ‚Äî is probably slowing down, partly as a result of weight loss itself, and partly as his body‚Äôs response to the loss of body fat. This reduces Bill‚Äôs total calorie expenditure, even though his activity level is the same. Bill will have to cut his calorie intake even more if he wants to continue losing weight.

    Question:Scientists turn to model organisms ‚Äî species that are easy to keep in the lab and have been studied extensively ‚Äî and use them as study subjects. Rats and mice, for example, are key to medical research. Dozens of mouse and rat strains have been specifically maintained as research subjects because they reliably develop problems like obesity, diabetes, or behavioral disorders such as addiction. How could research on mice or rats help answer our medical research questions ‚Äî questions that are, after all, about humans?
    Answer:We can test out medicines, for example, by giving them to diabetic mice. Or we can figure out what causes a health problem by doing experiments on mice that wouldn‚Äôt be possible with people. Such research is useful because mice and people are related by ancestry. We have similar organs, cells, and molecules. Something we learn in mice might apply directly to people, or it might at least point us in the right direction for further study.

    Answer:We can test out medicines, for example, by giving them to diabetic mice. Or we can figure out what causes a health problem by doing experiments on mice that wouldn‚Äôt be possible with people. Such research is useful because mice and people are related by ancestry. We have similar organs, cells, and molecules. Something we learn in mice might apply directly to people, or it might at least point us in the right direction for further study.

    Question:In addition to chlorophyll, plants produce other pigments. Some of them act as ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù to chlorophyll: they absorb different wavelengths of light and pass some of the energy to chlorophyll. For example, many plants contain orange and yellow pigments in their leaves. They are normally masked by the green chlorophyll, which is much more abundant in leaf tissues. When do we see these pigments in many plant leaves?
    Answer:In the fall, deciduous broadleaved tree leaves turn orange or yellow because chlorophyll levels in the leaves decline. Additional red and purple pigments may also be actively produced by the plant in autumn.
