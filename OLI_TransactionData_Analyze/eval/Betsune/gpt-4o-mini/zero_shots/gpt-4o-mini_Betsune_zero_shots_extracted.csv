What made Mendel’s experiments successful where others failed, was that he used only plants with true breeding traits, he looked at a limited number of traits, and each trait he studied only has two forms or phenotypes (purple or white flowers, smooth or wrinkles peas, etc.). By counting the number of offspring plants from his crosses that expressed each trait, he was able to determine which trait pair was stronger (dominant) and which was weaker (recessive). After repeated matings and evaluating his data he was then able to predict the outcomes of matings between plants.

What made Mendel’s experiments successful where others failed, was that he used only plants with true breeding traits, he looked at a limited number of traits, and each trait he studied only has two forms or phenotypes (purple or white flowers, smooth or wrinkles peas, etc.). By counting the number of offspring plants from his crosses that expressed each trait, he was able to determine which trait pair was stronger (dominant) and which was weaker (recessive). After repeated matings and evaluating his data he was then able to predict the outcomes of matings between plants. Because he was the first scientist to really understand how specific traits were inherited from one generation to the next, he has been dubbed the “Father of Modern Genetics”.

In statistical analysis, a result not being significant means that the data does not provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis, which suggests that there is no effect or difference.

Explanation: The student input states that ""proteins must flow inward,"" which is incorrect. The question specifically asks about protons, not proteins. The correct statement should indicate that protons (hydrogen ions) flow inward to increase the acidity of the lysosome compared to the cytoplasm.",Incorrect,"The student input states that ""proteins must flow inward,"" which is incorrect.

Explanation: The student's input does not answer the question or provide any information relevant to it. The phrase ""not too sure..."" indicates a lack of understanding or knowledge about the topic, rather than a correct or partially correct answer. The correct answer is that protons must flow inward to increase the proton concentration inside the lysosome, making it more acidic than the cytoplasm.",Incorrect,"The student's input does not answer the question or provide any information relevant to it.
