    Question: What are enzymes, substrate, and product?
    Answer: Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts (make it easier for chemical reactions to occur). Substrates are molecules that bind to an enzyme. For any given enzyme, one or more specific substrate molecules will bind to that enzyme. Substrates are then converted to product(s) by the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme.
    Student Input: Metabolic pathways consist of an ordered set of chemical reactions that are catalyzed by enzymes. At the heart of metabolism are enzymes. These proteins embrace substrates, quickly generating products. One or more substrates bind to an enzyme‚Äö√Ñ√¥s active site. As a result, the activation energy is reduced and the reaction proceeds much more quickly than it otherwise would. Without enzymes, metabolism would grind to a halt. Furthermore, the structural characteristics of enzymes allow the regulation of their function, thus allowing the regulation of the metabolic pathways they participate in.

    Question: You may have seen television programs that make weight loss into a contest, with the prize going to the contestant who takes off pounds the fastest. You may even have similar incentive programs in your own school, church, or workplace. Are these contests or incentives a good idea?
    Answer: Yes and no. It is a good idea for obese or overweight people to lose weight. Excess body fat can harm their health or interfere with their daily activities. However, weight loss should occur slowly in the context of permanent changes to a person‚Äôs lifestyle. Very rapid weight loss can be counterproductive, because the pounds are likely to pile back on as the person‚Äôs metabolism slows and hunger increases.

    Question: Why is pH regulated in your body? How is the pH of your blood regulated?
    Answer: Cells and living organisms can only function and survive in a very limited pH range. If pH is disrupted, the chemical reactions that enable life stop working. It is therefore an essential part of homeostasis to maintain the appropriate pH balance within a cell/organism. In diabetic ketoacidosis, a wide range of health problems and even death can result due to disruption of the body‚Äôs pH. In healthy people, blood pH is regulated partly through the action of a buffer (bicarbonate).

    Question: Why is pH regulated in your body? How is the pH of your blood regulated?
    Answer: Cells and living organisms can only function and survive in a very limited pH range. If pH is disrupted, the chemical reactions that enable life stop working. It is therefore an essential part of homeostasis to maintain the appropriate pH balance within a cell/organism. In diabetic ketoacidosis, a wide range of health problems and even death can result due to disruption of the body‚Äôs pH. In healthy people, blood pH is regulated partly through the action of a buffer (bicarbonate).
    Student Input: Ph is regulated in your body to help your body break down nutrients and ight off diseases. Ph in your blood is regulated by breaking down the contents that are diseases which it fights off infections with.

    Answer: The queen, being female has a pair of X chromosomes as her 23rd, sex determining pair of chromosomes. The gametes she produces will all contain an X chromosome. The king however, being male, contains one X and one Y chromosome as this 23rd pair or chromosomes. Therefore, the gametes he produces will either contain an X or a Y chromosome. Because the queen only produces X gametes, but the king produces X and Y gametes, the gender of their children is determined by which chromosome (X or Y) is found on the sperm which fertilizes the queen‚Äôs X containing gamete (her egg). Gender in humans is always determined by the father.

Because the queen only produces X gametes, but the king produces X and Y gametes, the gender of their children is determined by which chromosome (X or Y) is found on the sperm which fertilizes the queen‚Äôs X containing gamete (her egg). Gender in humans is always determined by the father.
    Student Input: because the father determines the sex of the heir, whether he gives the y chromosome or not

    Answer: Once again, there are lots of possible answers. We humans are dependent on algae and plants that produce food and oxygen gas, animals we harvest as food, and decomposers that get rid of wastes. They, in turn, may be dependent on us for cultivation (in the case of crop plants), protection, or a supply of food (the helpful bacteria in our sewage treatment plants would starve without us!). You probably came up with your own answer. Did the answer specifically describe how humans depend on the other species AND how the other species depends on us? If so, you‚Äôve got a good grasp of interdependence.
    Student Input: A biological system comprises of the considerable number of life forms living inside a characterized zone alongside the abiotic segments of that specific condition. Inside a biological system, creatures communicate with one another in supportive and hurtful manners. A few sorts of creatures assume covering jobs with different species (e.g., six types of oak tree may have comparative, if not indistinguishable, jobs in a woods). Others, in any case, assume interesting and basic jobs that different living beings rely on for their endurance. For instance, in a Colorado woodland, scientists found that a types of sapsucker (a winged creature like a woodpecker) assumed a crucial job in giving settling gaps and food to numerous different species.

    Student Input: Nearly 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from phytoplankton. If these organisms were to die off in large numbers or become extinct, we would see a great increase in carbon dioxide, along with a struggle to breathe due to a sudden decrease in oxygen. Phytoplankton absorb the carbon dioxide that we produce through respiration and other processes, storing them within and carrying them to the depths of the ocean when they die.

    Question: Describe an example of interdependence among cells within your body.
    Answer: There are many good answers. Your brain cells depend on freshly oxygenated blood flow, so if your lungs or heart stop functioning, your brain cells will die within several minutes. On the other hand, your lungs and heart work partly under the control of signals from your brain. You cannot digest food properly or make certain vitamins without help from bacteria in your gut, and these in turn depend on your body as a warm, nutrient-rich place to grow. Whatever example you came up with should have this sense of a two-way interaction: the cells are mutually dependent on one another. This is the core of the ‚Äúinterdependence‚Äù concept.

    Student Input: Two cell organelles that are interdependent are ribosomes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Ribosomes contain RNA and synthesize proteins. Ribosomes are structurally attached the rough endoplasmic reticulum, so obviously they rely on each other. Especially, because the rough E.R. helps process certain proteins at ribosomes. If one organelle existed without the other, neither of them would have a purpose, and are therefore interdependent.

    Answer: Genes code for enzyme proteins. When enzymes do not function normally, metabolic regulation is disrupted and health problems result.
    Student Input: this alteration could cause inhibition or an increase in function of an enzyme that is important to a metabolic pathway which would in turn cause other functions to not work correctly In a cascade. This would ultimately hinder the homeostatic state of the body that the cells are working to produce.

    Question: Over time, Bill continues to lose weight. At first he is averaging about one pound per week of weight loss. Gradually the rate of weight loss slows down, even though he sticks to the exact same level of calorie intake and exercise each day. Why, with the same calorie intake and activity level, would Bill‚Äôs weight loss slow down as he gets thinner?
    Answer: Bill‚Äôs basal metabolic rate (BMR) ‚Äî the number of calories used just to stay alive ‚Äî is probably slowing down, partly as a result of weight loss itself, and partly as his body‚Äôs response to the loss of body fat. This reduces Bill‚Äôs total calorie expenditure, even though his activity level is the same. Bill will have to cut his calorie intake even more if he wants to continue losing weight.

Because there are some characteristics of life they don‚Äôt possess, viruses are generally not considered to be alive.
    Student Input: i do not think viruses are alive because they have some of the qualities to be alive but not all of them exactly. A virus doesn't use the energy or do any work itself it has a host cell that does all the wok and uses their energy and all the virus does is attach on like a leech.

    Question: Ionic compounds dissolve and ionic bonds are broken in water. Why do you think water can separate ions and break ionic bonds?
    Answer: Ionic bonds involve charges interacting with each other. If water is added to an ionic compound (such as NaCl), the positively charged Na atoms are surrounded by water molecules with the oxygen (which have a slight negative charge) closest to the Na + . The negatively charged Cl is also surrounded by water molecules. In this case, the hydrogen atoms (which have a slight positive charge) are closest to the Cl - The water molecules surround each ion and disrupt the ionic bonds in this way.
    Student Input: Water is polar therefore it can break apart the opposite charges.

    Question: Why are heavily salted or sugared foods less susceptible to mold?
    Answer: Salts and sugars are solutes. High solute concentrations outside the cell (hypertonic solutions) cause water to flow out of the cell. This causes the cell to shrivel. Because mold cells (bacteria and fungi) have a cell wall, the hypertonic solution results in the plasma membrane tearing as it shrivels. This kills the cells and retards mold growth.
    Student Input: Salt or sugar, whether in solid or aqueous form attempts to reach equilibrium with the salt or sugar content of the food product with which it is in contact. This has the effect of drawing the available water from within the food outside and inserting salt or sugar molecules into the food interior. Which causes a reduction of the product water activity, a measure of free water molecules in the food that is necessary to keep mold from foods.

    Question: Are buffers an unlimited guarantee that the pH of a solution will remain in a narrow range?
    Answer: No, they only can deal with a limited quantity of acid or base. If acid or base is continuously added to a buffered solution, eventually the buffering capacity will be used up. The buffer will not be able to absorb or donate any more hydrogen ions, and the solution‚Äôs pH will start to change quickly if even more acid or base is added.
    Student Input: No exhibit very little change but it helps maintain an appropriate pH

    Question: What did Mendel do that led him to be called the ‚ÄúFather of Modern Genetics?"
    Answer: Mendel was the first person to use ‚Äútrue breeding‚Äù plants, manually mate them, and follow the outcomes of offspring. What made Mendel‚Äôs experiments successful where others failed, was that he used only plants with true breeding traits, he looked at a limited number of traits, and each trait he studied only has two forms or phenotypes (purple or white flowers, smooth or wrinkles peas, etc.). By counting the number of offspring plants from his crosses that expressed each trait, he was able to determine which trait pair was stronger (dominant) and which was weaker (recessive). After repeated matings and evaluating his data he was then able to predict the outcomes of matings between plants. Because he was the first scientist to really understand how specific traits were inherited from one generation to the next, he has been dubbed the ‚ÄúFather of Modern Genetics‚Äù. He laid the ground work for the field of genetics as we know it today.

For example, many plants contain orange and yellow pigments in their leaves. They are normally masked by the green chlorophyll, which is much more abundant in leaf tissues. When do we see these pigments in many plant leaves?
    Answer: In the fall, deciduous broadleaved tree leaves turn orange or yellow because chlorophyll levels in the leaves decline. Additional red and purple pigments may also be actively produced by the plant in autumn.

    Question: To make the lumen of the lysosome (the part enclosed by the lysosomal membrane) more acidic than the cytoplasm, in which direction would protons need to flow? Why?
    Answer: Protons would have to flow inwards, since a more acidic environment indicates a higher proton (hydrogen ion) concentration.
    Student Input: To carry out this function, the lysosome maintains a very low internal pH compared to that of the cytoplasm. Thus, there is a steep pH gradient across the lysosome's membrane. This contrasts with the equilibrium state, in which the concentration of hydrogen ions would be the same inside and outside the lysosome.

    Question: Provide a definition of evolution, in your own words.
    Answer: Evolution is a theory that describes how life changes over time. It is about populations or species (not individuals) changing over generations of time (not within single lifetimes). Inheritance ties one generation to the next and helps explain why organisms are similar. Natural selection is a process that helps explain how groups of organisms evolve and adapt to their surroundings. Both of these are part of the overall theory of evolution.
    Student Input: Evolution is simply a change for the better over time to insure survival. The stronger, more efficient organisms will survive better than the weak ones, which eventually creates an overall stronger and more efficient species as a whole.

    Question: ATP is continuously built to replace what is consumed by the activities of the cell. What can you predict about a reaction that would build ATP from ADP and P? Would it release or require energy?
    Answer: It would require energy, because you are establishing a bond that holds two like charges close together.
    Student Input: A chemical reaction where a molecule is split into two molecules. The breaking of this bond requires breaking a water molecule. ATP is converted to ADP and Pi. ... When this bond is broken, energy is released: ADP and P are lower in energy than the ATP they replace.
