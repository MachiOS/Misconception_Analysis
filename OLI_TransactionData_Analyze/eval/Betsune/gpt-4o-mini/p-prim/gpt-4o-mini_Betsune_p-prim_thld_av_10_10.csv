Substrates are molecules that bind to an enzyme. For any given enzyme, one or more specific substrate molecules will bind to that enzyme. Substrates are then converted to product(s) by the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme.",_m3_enzm_substrate_product_SC,_m3_enzm_substrate_product_SC-DIGTq1_A UpdateShortAnswer,"Metabolic pathways consist of an ordered set of chemical reactions that are catalyzed by enzymes. At the heart of metabolism are enzymes. These proteins embrace substrates, quickly generating products. One or more substrates bind to an enzyme‚Äö√Ñ√¥s active site. As a result, the activation energy is reduced and the reaction proceeds much more quickly than it otherwise would. Without enzymes, metabolism would grind to a halt. Furthermore, the structural characteristics of enzymes allow the regulation of their function, thus allowing the regulation of the metabolic pathways they participate in.",89,25.92307692,2,correct input
